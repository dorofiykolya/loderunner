Free and Open Source 'Lode Runner' Game for Mobile Phones (J2ME MIDlet)
  * Clone of the original Apple II version
  * Both 'LodeRunner' and 'LoderRunner Championship' versions are supported (300 levels total)
  * Source is heavily commented
  * Tested with Nokia phone MIDP 2.0 (should be easily portable to MIDP 1.0)

I recommand the following fork from Pablo Grisafi who significantly improved my version, especially with regards to portability.
